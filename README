This repository is based on [buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) and contains a
pre-configured .cofing file to build a working bootloader, linux kernel and
rootfs containing busybox and something more.

1) run 'make -j4' replace 4 with the number of thread you want to use
2) wait until it finishes to compile
3) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

Remember that if you are building from a clean environment the tool will
download approximatively 200 MB of data.
